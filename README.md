👨‍💻 About Me
I’m Karann Mishra, a Full Stack Engineer and AI/ML enthusiast who enjoys building
end-to-end systems that combine software engineering with machine learning.

I work comfortably across:

frontend & backend development

data pipelines & ML workflows

model integration into real applications

I care about clean architecture, reliable data, and production-ready solutions —
not just experiments that live in notebooks.

🧠 Engineering Philosophy
Design systems before writing code

Treat data pipelines as first-class citizens

Prefer simple, explainable models before complex ones

Build ML that integrates smoothly into real products

Write maintainable code that teams can actually extend

This allows me to ship solutions that work in production, not only demos.

Full-stack web applications with intelligent features

Applied Machine Learning & model fine-tuning

Data preprocessing & feature engineering

REST APIs & backend services for ML systems

Model evaluation, monitoring & performance analysis

Automation and reproducible workflows
